• Game Progress: Your high scores, gold balance, owned items, achievements, and game statistics are stored to preserve your progress.


Anonymous Authentication

The Application uses anonymous authentication through Firebase to save your game progress without requiring you to create an account with personal information such as email or password. A unique anonymous identifier is automatically generated for your device.


Account Recovery System

A recovery code is automatically generated for your account. This code allows you to restore your game progress if you switch devices or reinstall the Application. The recovery code is linked to your game data but does not contain personal information.

Important: If you choose to set a display name, your name and high score will be visible to all other players on the public leaderboard. Do not use your real name or any personally identifiable information as your display name if you wish to remain anonymous.
